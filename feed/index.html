<p>Bhaktivedanta Club has been existing in IITK since 1980&#8217;s, when it was first started by some M.Tech students. It was then rejuvenated in 2002 by Prof. Laxmidhar Behera(Dr. Lila Purushottam Das) of Electrical Engineering department. He used to conduct regular classes on Bhagavad Gita (BG), both in his residence as well as on the Institute level. Many other faculty members are also well wishers of the club. The main objectives of this club are: To make people understand the actual philosophy of Bhagavad Gita and the Sanatana Dharma [Eternal religion of the jiva to serve God] To connect spirituality with science. To revive the heritage of Indian culture. To remove stress and anxiety by Japa meditation.</p>

<p>“That supreme abode of mine is not illuminated by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.” In His abode, there is no need of sun, moon and electricity. Everything is self-effulgent. The rays radiating from Krishna illuminates everything. From Krishna comes His expansion Maha Vishnu, who lies in the Causal Ocean. While lying in this ocean, innumerable material universes emanate from the pores of Maha Vishnu’s body. From every pore of His body, one universe comes out by His sweet desire. For Maha Vishnu, these universes are like mustard seeds. Thus, effortlessly, He creates these material universes. Within any material world, living entities are driven by three modes of material nature, namely, goodness, passion and ignorance. Nobody, including Lord Brahma, is a free individual; everybody is forced to act helplessly under these three modes. This chapter will discuss the nature of the three modes, and the process of getting freed from the influence of these modes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does the world look like 100 years from now?<br />
The work on conscious (semantic) machines will take center stage. There will be more literacy in consciousness. If that happens, there is a BIG hope for the future. In fact, I am working towards establishing an University where this subject can be systematically studied from different perspectives &#8211; science, art, philosophy and culture. There will be more such initiatives from many parts of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Purport<br />
The body of intelligence enjoys the objects of sense gratification that cover it, such as smell, vision and hearing. The word sunāsām, “beautiful nose,” indicates the organ for acquiring knowledge by smell. Similarly, the mouth is the instrument for acquiring knowledge by taste, for by chewing an object and touching it with the tongue we can understand its taste. The word sukapolām, “nice forehead,” indicates a clear brain capable of understanding things as they are. By intelligence one can set things in order. The earrings set upon the two ears are placed there by the work of the intelligence. Thus the ways of acquiring knowledge are described metaphorically.</p>
